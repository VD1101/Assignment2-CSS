          Once upon a younger year<br />When all our shadows disappeared
        </p>
        <p>
          The animals inside came out to play<br />Went face to face with all
          our fears
        </p>
        <p>
          Learned our lessons through the tears<br />Made memories we knew would
          never fade
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
        </p>
        <p>He took me in his arms, I heard him say:</p>
        <p class="highlight">
          "When you get older, your wild heart will live for younger days<br />Think
          of me if ever you're afraid"
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind<br />So live a life
          you will remember."
        </p>
        <p>
          My father told me when I was just a child<br />"These are the nights
          that never die"
        </p>
        <p>My father told me...</p>
